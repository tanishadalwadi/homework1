I created a repository in the github
After that I created a file in a github and cloned it.
I pushed it to the main branch.
I created another branch and another file "two.txt" by using "git checkout -b new" command.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream is used "git push --set-upstream origin new" command. 
Whichhelped me push the new branch and changes into the git. 
I used rebase command git rebase main new to rebase both branches. 
And pushed everything again just to be sure. 
After that I checkd the status using "git status". 
And everything was uptodate.
